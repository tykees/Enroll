        <p class="pt-2 inner-text">We create the school server for Schools to have control over their students and get benefits from their activities on Typeearn. Schools are required to buy and burn a certain amount of the Typecoin TPC through Steem-Engine to upload their student on the server. It is highly recommended for all schools as students learn from over 2000 terms in various subjects, as they improve their typing skills.</p>

    <p>Typing is one of the most important computer skills that students can learn easily. It remains a fundamental skill that is needed in all areas as far as education is concerned. Learning to improve typing skills at a tender age has the added advantage of preparing students for more complex writing assignments. Students in higher learning do most of their works on a computer. Internet research, assignments, homework, group presentation, development, and so on are done with computer system, and students who peck on their keyboards find it difficult to produce good and neat work at the stipulated time. </p>

    <p>Acquiring good typing skills can help students to improve their productivity, career prospects and also pave way for success in further education. Moreover, the benefit of using typeearn to acquire this skill goes beyond. All the words the students will be typing are terms and definitions within their class range. Each round of typing can be seen as a revision or learning period. Constant use will definitely have a good impact on their learning and it will improve their performance.</p>

    <h2 class="display-4">Enjoy Typeearn! <i class="fa fa-coffee"></i></h2>
